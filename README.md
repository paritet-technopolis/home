| Orc.Metadata          | Provides base classes to store metadata about objects. This can be useful for a lot of information about objects. Might seem abstract, but this prevents you from repeating the same code over and over again.                                                                                                                              |
| Orc.Notifications     | Show desktop notifications to the user with the ability to add commands to the notifications. In a few lines of code you have beautiful notifications in your app.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Orc.NuGetExplorer     | A custom NuGet explorer. We use this because plugins of our applications are deployed via NuGet.

| Orc.ProjectManagement | Manage files and projects inside your application. Instead of messing around with lots of handlers and events, this library manages projects for you (can be a file, directory, database, really anything). Other components can subscribe to this if they are interested. Are you writing document-focused apps? You really want this one. |
